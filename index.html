        <p>
          2000 thousand years ago, a kingdom was invaded by the worst enemies.
          They took advantage that the guardian warrior was not in his tower,
          for some reason, and invaded the kingdom. It was the guardian's duty
          to defend his kingdom, but unfortunately he failed. Now the kingdom
          will have another chance to win the battle because you will be the
          guardian. 
        </p>
        <p> Are you ready to save the kingdom?</p>
